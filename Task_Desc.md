Here is the updated list of 15 tasks, including new tasks for outlier detection and removal, and using `stratify` in the train-test split. Each task is explained with clear, specific bullet points.

---

### **Task 1: Load and Explore the Data**
- Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
- Display the first few rows of the dataset using `.head()` to get an initial look.
- Use the `.info()` method to check data types and identify missing values.

---

### **Task 2: Summary Statistics**
- Use the `.describe()` method to generate summary statistics for all numerical columns.
- This will give insights into the range, mean, and spread of the data.

---

### **Task 3: Missing Values Check**
- Check for missing values in the dataset.
- Use `.isnull().sum()` to get the count of missing values in each column.
- Identify which columns have missing data for handling later.

---

### **Task 4: Distribution of the Target Variable**
- Use `.value_counts()` to check the distribution of the `winback_success` target variable.
- Look for class imbalances (i.e., whether there are significantly more 0's than 1's or vice versa).

---

### **Task 5: Visualize Numerical Features**
- Import the `seaborn` and `matplotlib` libraries for plotting.
- Plot histograms using `sns.histplot()` for numerical columns: `user_tenure`, `num_logins_last_30_days`, `num_transactions_last_30_days`, `app_usage_time`, and `discount_offered`.
- Examine these plots to check for skewness and potential outliers.

---

### **Task 6: Outlier Detection (Numerical Features)**
- Identify outliers in the numerical features using boxplots.
- Use `sns.boxplot()` for numerical columns to visualize potential outliers.
- Focus on columns such as `user_tenure`, `num_logins_last_30_days`, and `app_usage_time`, as these may have extreme values.

---

### **Task 7: Categorical Features Analysis**
- Plot bar charts for categorical features: `customer_segment`, `campaign_type`, `prev_winback_success`.
- Use `sns.countplot()` to check the frequency distribution of each category.
- Identify if any categories dominate or are under-represented.

---

### **Task 8: Handle Missing Data**
- For `discount_offered`, fill missing values with the median value using `.fillna()`.
- Drop rows where `re_engagement_date` is missing using `.dropna()` for this specific column.

---

### **Task 9: Outlier Removal**
- Remove outliers using the IQR (Interquartile Range) method.
- Calculate the lower bound and upper bound for outlier detection (1.5 times IQR).
- Filter out rows where numerical features fall outside these bounds.

---

### **Task 10: Feature Engineering**
- Create a new feature `days_until_re_engagement`, which calculates the number of days between `unsub_date` and `re_engagement_date`.
- Convert the date columns to datetime format using `pd.to_datetime()`.
- Subtract `unsub_date` from `re_engagement_date` to get the difference in days.

---

### **Task 11: Train-Test Split with Stratification**
- Select your feature columns (`X`) and target variable (`y`).
- Use `train_test_split()` from `sklearn.model_selection` to split the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Use the `stratify=y` option to ensure class distribution in the train and test sets matches the original dataset.

---

### **Task 12: Build a Classification Model**
- Import `LogisticRegression` from `sklearn.linear_model`.
- Initialize the logistic regression model and fit it to the training data.
- Ensure that the model is learning the relationship between features and the target variable.

---

### **Task 13: Model Evaluation**
- Use the trained model to predict on the test set.
- Calculate evaluation metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Import these metrics from `sklearn.metrics` and print the values to evaluate the modelâ€™s performance.

---

### **Task 14: Feature Importance**
- Get the feature coefficients using `.coef_` from the logistic regression model.
- Print the feature names and their corresponding coefficients to understand which features are most important in predicting win-back success.
- Focus on which features have the highest positive or negative impact.

---

### **Task 15: Predict on New Data**
- Select a few samples from the test set to make new predictions.
- Use the `.predict()` method on these samples.
- Display the predicted values for these new data points to see if the model generalizes well.

---

### **Task 16: Calculate the Win-Back Ratio**
- Calculate the baseline win-back success rate by finding the mean of the `winback_success` column.
- Calculate the predicted success rate using the model predictions (`y_pred` from Task 13).
- Compute the percentage improvement by comparing the predicted success rate to the baseline.
- Interpret the improvement to measure the impact of your model.

---

This set of 16 tasks will guide a beginner-level data scientist step by step through the process of performing exploratory data analysis, detecting and removing outliers, building models, and finally calculating the win-back ratio. Each task is clear and includes sufficient detail for the user to understand what needs to be done without ambiguity.
