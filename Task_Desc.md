Here’s a breakdown of the 15 tasks with clear, step-by-step bullet points, aimed at guiding a beginner-level data scientist to write their own code. The focus is to help them understand what needs to be done at each step without ambiguity.

---

### **Task 1: Load and Explore the Data**
- Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
- Display the first few rows of the dataset to get an initial look.
- Use the `.info()` method to check data types and the presence of any missing values.

---

### **Task 2: Summary Statistics**
- Use the `.describe()` method to generate summary statistics for all numerical columns.
- This should give you a good idea of the range, mean, and spread of the data.

---

### **Task 3: Missing Values Check**
- Check if there are any missing values in the dataset.
- Use the `.isnull().sum()` method to get the count of missing values in each column.
- Identify which columns need attention for handling missing data.

---

### **Task 4: Distribution of the Target Variable**
- Find the distribution of the target column `winback_success`.
- Use `.value_counts()` to count the unique values (0 and 1).
- Check if the dataset is imbalanced (i.e., one class significantly outnumbers the other).

---

### **Task 5: Visualize Numerical Features**
- Import `matplotlib` and `seaborn` libraries for visualization.
- Plot histograms for the following columns: `user_tenure`, `num_logins_last_30_days`, `num_transactions_last_30_days`, `app_usage_time`, and `discount_offered`.
- Use `sns.histplot()` to plot the distribution of these columns and examine their shapes (normal, skewed, etc.).

---

### **Task 6: Categorical Features Analysis**
- Plot bar charts for categorical columns: `customer_segment`, `campaign_type`, `prev_winback_success`.
- Use `sns.countplot()` to show the frequency of each category.
- This will help you understand how different categories are distributed in your data.

---

### **Task 7: Correlation Analysis**
- Compute the correlation matrix using `.corr()` to understand relationships between numerical features.
- Use a heatmap from `seaborn` (`sns.heatmap()`) to visualize these correlations.
- Focus on any strong correlations (close to +1 or -1).

---

### **Task 8: Handle Missing Data**
- Identify columns with missing data from Task 3.
- For `discount_offered`, fill missing values with the median using `.fillna()`.
- For `re_engagement_date`, drop rows with missing values using `.dropna()`.

---

### **Task 9: Feature Engineering**
- Create a new feature, `days_until_re_engagement`, which calculates the difference between `unsub_date` and `re_engagement_date`.
- Convert these columns to date format using `pd.to_datetime()`.
- Subtract the two date columns and convert the result to integer days.

---

### **Task 10: Train-Test Split**
- Define the input features (`X`) and the target variable (`y`).
- Select columns like `user_tenure`, `num_logins_last_30_days`, `num_transactions_last_30_days`, etc., as your features.
- Use `train_test_split()` from `sklearn.model_selection` to split your data into training and testing sets (80-20 split).

---

### **Task 11: Build a Classification Model**
- Import `LogisticRegression` from `sklearn.linear_model`.
- Create an instance of the model and fit it on the training data (`X_train`, `y_train`).
- Ensure the model learns the relationships between the features and the target variable.

---

### **Task 12: Model Evaluation**
- Predict on the test set (`X_test`) using the `.predict()` method.
- Import accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics from `sklearn.metrics`.
- Calculate each metric for the predictions and display the results.

---

### **Task 13: Feature Importance**
- After training the model, retrieve the model coefficients using `.coef_` to understand feature importance.
- Print the features and their corresponding coefficients to see which features are most influential.
- Interpret which features have positive or negative impacts on the prediction.

---

### **Task 14: Predict on New Data**
- Take a few samples from your test set (`X_test`) and predict the win-back success.
- Use the model’s `.predict()` method on the new data.
- Display the predicted values to understand how the model generalizes to unseen data.

---

### **Task 15: Calculate the Win-Back Ratio**
- Calculate the baseline win-back success rate (before the model) by taking the mean of the `winback_success` column.
- Calculate the predicted win-back success rate after applying the model (using `y_pred` from Task 12).
- Compute the percentage improvement in win-back success by comparing the predicted success rate to the baseline.

This step-by-step approach will guide the beginner through writing their own code for each task while understanding why each task is important. The instructions are concise, clear, and structured to eliminate ambiguity.
